This is my 3D animation of a beach ball. The beach ball mesh itself was from [sketchfab](https://sketchfab.com/3d-models/beach-ball-free-download-c915a99e9bae4dbe8dd7be3215e19ba0#download), however i turned it to lego on my owm. I initially planned to use a pineapple however the textures were not properly applying on it, so i had to switch to a simpler object. The animation can be viewed in output.gif or output.mp4
